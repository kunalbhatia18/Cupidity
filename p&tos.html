        <h3> Privacy Policy </h3>
        <p>This explains how we collect, store, protect, and share your information, and with 
            whom we share it. Whilst you're enjoying the Cupidity mobile application ("App"), we collect 
            some information about you. In addition, you may choose to use the App to share information 
            with other members, including your friends and contacts ("Users"). We may also need to share 
            your information sometimes.</p>
        <p>Cupidity is a global app, and your information will be sent to and used in India 
            regardless of the country you reside in. This Policy explains how we protect your personal 
            data when we transfer it overseas, so please read very carefully!</p>
        <p><b>1. Where This Privacy Policy Applies : </b> This Privacy Policy applies to websites, 
            apps, events and other services operated by Cupidity. For simplicity, we refer to all of 
            these as our “services” in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we’ve added links to 
            this Privacy Policy on all applicable services. Some services may require their own unique
            privacy policy. If a particular service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not 
            this Privacy Policy -- applies.</p>
            <p><b>Data Storage :</b> By using the App, you acknowledge that Cupidity is a global app operating through 
                servers located in a number of countries around the world, including the United States. 
                If you live in a country with data protection laws, the storage of your personal data may 
                provide you with the same protections as you enjoy in your country of residence.
        </p>
        <p><b>2. Collection Of Information: </b>When you download the App and create an account ("Account"), we may collect certain 
            information ("Registration Information") about you, such as: <br>
            •Name<br>
            •Email address<br>
            •Mobile number<br>
            •Gender identity<br>
            •Age<br>
            •Sexual preference<br>
            •Photographs<br>
            •Login information and friend lists for social media accounts that you connect to your Cupidity Account 
            (this could include, for example, your Facebook and Instagram accounts 
            ("Social Media Accounts"). <br>
            You can change your gender identity and preferences at anytime by accessing “Edit bio” page.
        </p>
        <p><b>Additional Information:</b>
            We may also collect additional information in connection with your use of Cupidity, 
            for example if you use our super cool electronic messaging function.<br>
            If you contact our Customer Support team, we will receive your email address, and may track 
            your IP address as well as the information you send to us to help resolve your query. We will 
            keep records of our communications with you, including any complaints that we receive from you 
            about other Users (and from other Users about you).<br>
            We recommend and encourage you (and all our members) to think carefully about the information 
            you disclose about yourself. We also do not recommend that you put email addresses, URLs, 
            instant messaging details, phone numbers, full names or addresses, credit card details, national 
            identity numbers, drivers' licence details and other sensitive information on your profile which 
            is open to abuse and misuse. Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on 
            your profile.<br>
            Please remember that photographs that you post on Cupidity may reveal information about 
            yourself as well. Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive information about 
            yourself, including through adding certain Badges to your profile, you are explicitly 
            consenting to our processing of your information and making this public to other users.<br>
            When you post information about yourself or use the messaging function, the amount of 
            personal information you share is at your own risk. 
            We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how you use 
            them (e.g., date and time you logged in, features you’ve been using, searches, clicks 
            and pages which have been shown to you, referring webpage address, advertising that you 
            click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, 
            time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive).</p>

    <b>5. How We Share Information: </b> Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, 
    the main sharing of users’ information is, of course, with other users. <br>
    <b>a) With other users</b><br>
    You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service 
    (including your public profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the

<p>
    <b>6. Data Storage : </b> By using the App, you acknowledge that Cupidity is a global app 
    operating through servers located in a number of countries around the world, including the United 
    States. If you live in a country with data protection laws, the storage of your personal data may 
    not provide you with the same protections as you enjoy in your country of residence.<br>
    We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes. 
    In practice, we delete or anonymise your information upon deletion of your account.

</p>
<p>
    <b>7. Your Rights : </b>We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided 
    you with the <b>following tools:</b><br>
    <b>•Access / Update tools in the service:</b> Tools and account settings that help you to access, 
    rectify or delete information that you provided to us and that’s associated with your account 
    directly within the service. If you have any question on those tools and settings, please contact 
    our customer care team for help. <br>
    <b>•Device permissions:</b> Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device 
    data and notifications, such as phone book and location services as well as push notifications. 
    You can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the 
    corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you 
    do that, certain services may lose full functionality.<br>
    <b>•Deletion:</b> You can delete your account by using the corresponding functionality directly 
    on the service.<br>
    <b>We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key points to remember:</b><br>
    <b>•Reviewing your information:</b> Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to 
    review the personal information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be 
    called right of access, right of portability or variations of those terms). You can request a copy 
    of your personal information by putting in such a request.<br>
    <b>•Updating your information:</b> If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate 
    or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion or 
    object to its processing, please contact us.<br>
    For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of 
    identity before we can answer the above requests.<br>
    Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, 
    including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual 
    property or the privacy of another user. If you wish to receive information relating to another 
    user, such as a copy of any messages you received from him or her through our service, the other 
    user will have to contact our Privacy Officer to provide their written consent before the 
    information is released.
    Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal 
    information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. 
    For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth.<br>
    <b>•Uninstall :</b> You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling 
    it using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall the app from your 
    mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. 
    If you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate 
    this identifier to your previous transactions and activities.<br>
    <b>•Accountability:</b>In certain countries, including in the European Union, you have a right 
    to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about 
    how we process your personal information. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint 
    with notably may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where we are established.<br>

</p>
<p>
    <b>8. Our Policy Towards Age : </b> Our services are restricted to users who are 18 years of age or older. 
    We do not permit users under the age of 18 on our platform and we do not knowingly collect 
    personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you suspect that a user is under 
    the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available through the service.
</p>

<p>
    <b>9. How We Protect Your Information :</b> We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or 
    alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all technology companies, 
    although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that 
    your personal information will always remain secure.<br>
    We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review 
    our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical 
    and organizational security measures.<br>
    We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect 
    any breach of security. If you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, 
    please notify us immediately. <br>

</p>
<p><b>
        10. How Long We Retain Your Information :
</b>  There is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information 
until it is resolved; or <br>
The information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and 
enhancing users' safety and security. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent 
a user who was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a new account.  <br>
Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion 
processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted 
within a specific timeframe due to technical constraints.<br>
</p>

<p>
    <b>11. Privacy Policy Changes :</b> Because we’re always looking for new and innovative ways 
    to help you build meaningful connections, this policy may change over time. The most recent 
    version will be put up on “Privacy Policy” in settings page. If you continue to use the service 
    after the changes become effective, then you agree to the revised Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
    <b>12. Third Party Accounts :</b> If you have registered with Cupidity using a third party social 
    media platform, such as Facebook, your Cupidity profile will be available to all Users of Cupidity 
    whether via our App or our partners' websites.<br>
    Remember that when you register with a third party, you are also giving them personal information, 
    so we recommend that you read their privacy policies as Cupidity does not control how they use their 
    information.<br>
    If you have registered on one of these third party websites, such as Facebook, 
    or you have verified your Account via a third party website, we may connect your Cupidity 
    profile with your profile on such website. We may do this by way of new products and applications 
    which we introduce from time to time, including new products powered by our group companies.<br>
    If you have created a Cupidity profile through a third party website and you do not want to link 
    your Cupidity profile to your profile on the third party website, Cupidity cannot amend 
    these settings. Please visit the application settings on your third party website profile and 
    follow the instructions to remove the Cupidity access permissions.<br>
    We only use the APIs, OAuth Tokens, Widgets, or other means provided by the applicable Social Media Account to integrate your 
    Social Media Account with our App. As such, we only receive the limited information that 
    each Social Media Account permits to be transferred.<br>
